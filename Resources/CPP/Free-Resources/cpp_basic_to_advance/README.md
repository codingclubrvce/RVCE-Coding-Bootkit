# Basic to Advance C++

Welcome to the **C++ Basic to Advance** resource folder! This section is designed to help you learn C++ programming from scratch and progress to advanced concepts. Whether you're a beginner or looking to strengthen your C++ skills, you'll find curated tutorials, sample codes, and mini-projects here.

> **Note:** These resources are custom notes and code samples created while following [CodeWithHarry's C++ course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agpFUAlPFe_VNSlXW5uE0YL&feature=shared).

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **cwh-cpp-course/**  
  Contains step-by-step C++ tutorials, sample code files, and exercises inspired by popular online courses.

- **Projects/**  
  Mini-projects and practical applications to help you apply your C++ knowledge.

- **Bonus Project**
  I have also added one of my own projects **QuizCraze** at the end, which I built during my first semester for the C++ elective EL. If you feel the sample projects are basic you can always check this out: [quiz-craze](https://github.com/VishalBhat07/quiz-craze)

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Start with the Tutorials:**  
   Open the files in `cwh-cpp-course/` in order (e.g., `tut1.cpp`, `tut2.cpp`, ...) to follow a structured learning path.

2. **Practice with Samples:**  
   Try running and modifying the sample `.cpp` files and text files to understand each concept.

3. **Build Projects:**  
   Explore the `Projects/` folder for hands-on coding challenges and mini-projects.

## üìö Topics Covered

- Printing "Hello World"
- C++ syntax and basics
- Functions, loops, and conditionals
- Pointers
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling
- Template classes
- 2 Sample projects + 1 bonus project

## üí° Tips

- Use a C++ IDE or online compiler to run the code samples.
- Experiment by changing code and observing the results.
- Refer to comments in the code for explanations.
