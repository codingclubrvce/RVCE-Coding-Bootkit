# ðŸš© CTF (Capture The Flag)

_A comprehensive guide to cybersecurity challenges, ethical hacking, and penetration testing through CTF competitions._

<br>

## ðŸ“š What is CTF?

Capture The Flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve various challenges to find hidden "flags" - pieces of data that prove successful completion of a task. CTFs are excellent for learning:

- **Web Exploitation** - SQL injection, XSS, CSRF attacks
- **Binary Exploitation** - Buffer overflows, reverse engineering
- **Cryptography** - Encryption, hashing, steganography
- **Forensics** - File analysis, network packet inspection
- **Reverse Engineering** - Malware analysis, code decompilation
- **Steganography** - Hidden data in images, audio, files

ðŸ§  **Perfect for cybersecurity enthusiasts and ethical hackers!**
